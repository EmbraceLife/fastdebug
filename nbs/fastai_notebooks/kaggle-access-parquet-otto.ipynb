I carried out the processing on my local machine and uploaded the processed data (will share the code I used for processing as well, please see [the associate thread](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/otto-recommender-system/discussion/363843)).\n\nThe 'type' information was represented as a string, which takes up a lot of memory. Instead, I cast it to `np.uint8`. This makes the data much smaller and easier to work with without any loss of information!\n\nLet me walk you through how everything is set up so that you can use this data in your work.","metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### rd: recsys - otto - access parquet - copy and paste dataset path - !ls ../input/otto-full-optimized-memory-footprint/","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Here are the files\n!ls ../input/otto-full-optimized-memory-footprint/","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-11-11T05:44:15.414543Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-11-11T05:44:15.415691Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-11-11T05:44:16.426362Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-11-11T05:44:15.415569Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-11-11T05:44:16.425130Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### rd: recsys - otto - access parquet - pd.read_parquet('../input/otto-full-optimized-memory-footprint/train.parquet')","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"import pandas as pd\n\n# There is a version of the data stored as `csv` as well\n# but I recommend you use `parquet` as I do here -- it is much faster\n\ntrain = pd.read_parquet('../input/otto-full-optimized-memory-footprint/train.parquet')\ntest = pd.read_parquet('../input/otto-full-optimized-memory-footprint/test.parquet')","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-11-11T05:44:16.625657Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-11-11T05:44:16.626031Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-11-11T05:44:34.319824Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-11-11T05:44:16.626002Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-11-11T05:44:34.318677Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"train.head()","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-11-11T05:44:34.321625Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-11-11T05:44:34.322040Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-11-11T05:44:34.339337Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-11-11T05:44:34.322000Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-11-11T05:44:34.338227Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"The `type` column has been encoded as integers.
