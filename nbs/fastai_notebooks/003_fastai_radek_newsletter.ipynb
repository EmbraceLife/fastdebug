    "So you have started to talk online about your work and people are starting to get to know you. Great!\n",

    "### jn: radek - newsletter - why popularity on twitter is not what you really need (>90% knows little of you) /2022-11-15\n",
    "\n",
    "You might think -- oh, but look at this guy on Twitter. He has 20k followers. Now that is what I need as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "The truth is, you couldn't be further from the truth! Connections on Twitter are mostly shallow. Upwards of 90% of people who follow you know very little (and care very little) about who you are.\n",
    "\n",
    "They just saw an interesting tweet from you once or twice and clicked the \"follow\" button, that is all.\n",
    "\n",
    "Point is -- there are people with 100k followers on Twitter and their audience can be mostly useless to them.\n",
    "\n",
    "### jn: radek - newsletter - what kind of followers do you need (insider of industry) /2022-11-15\n",
    "\n",
    "But I digress. The point is this -- even if through your work 4, 10, or 20 people in the industry have gotten to know of your existence, that is fantastic! That is very valuable capital you didn't have before.\n",
    "\n",
    "So how did I get my 3rd ML job? And mind you, now we are entering into really good job territory. Making great money working on interesting problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "The answer might seem very simple BUT STILL MOST PEOPLE DON'T DO THIS.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is not natural to us. For many people, it is not something that is part of our cultural repertoire.\n",
    "\n",
    "### jn: radek - newsletter - how did Radek get his third job? (sharing an interesting project) /2022-11-15\n",
    "\n",
    "If you go deeper on something in a project, share something that might be **useful to users of popular libraries**, or **put together a howto that can help a community**... chances are you might appear as a blip on someone's radar. Someone who might be an \"industry insider\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Hell, **if you are interesting enough**, some of these people will reach out to you and introduce themselves in a DM! Or you might get to know them at a conference or a meet-up in real life.\n",
    "\n",
    "So how is all of that relevant? Well, if you are looking for a job, TELL OTHERS that you are looking for a job. This is the crucial ingredient, I cannot overemphasize it enough.\n",
    "\n",
    "**If you've met this one person who took interest in your projects, and they seem like someone who is well connected in the industry, send them an email asking if they know of any openings that might be suitable to your skillset.**\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are feeling particularly adventerous, put that info (that you are looking for a new role) in your Twitter display name. People use that all the time to advertise all sort of things.\n",
    "\n",
    "Take a look at my display name below\n",

    "\n",
    "Of course, don't become a spammer. **Only reach out personally to people whom you've built a connection with AND that plausibly can help you**. As long as you are tactful and don't hope for a response, you should be good.\n",
    "\n",
    "So how did I get my 3rd ML job? I sent an email to a person who told me a couple of months earlier that if I ever needed help with finding work, I should talk to them. In 24 hours I had a round of interviews and started to work in less than 48.\n",
    "\n",
    "That's it for today. Remember -- **don't forget to tell the world what you want**! You might just be handed it on a silver platter if you do!\n",

If you've built a relationship with someone, provided them something of value, YOU can ask for help. Be that help on showing appreciation on something of value that you wrote, or help in finding you a job. But value has to come first... guess this will be the theme of my next newsletter\n",

    "### jn: out of desperation (keep running out of RAM by copying and running local validation notebook from Radek, all versions are tried) I started to experiment every line of Radek's local validation notebook, and to my surprise I get the notebook to run without error this time by removing `/1000` from one line of code. Then I figured out what problem does `/1000` cause which seems to be a bug. However, I have no idea how such a 'bug' cause me to run out of RAM and no problem for Radek and seemingly everybody else.  /2022-11-16\n",

However, I am very slow on writing it up as great kaggler like Radek and Chris are faster in making new notebooks than I can read and experiment them. What shall I do? /2022-11-16\n",
