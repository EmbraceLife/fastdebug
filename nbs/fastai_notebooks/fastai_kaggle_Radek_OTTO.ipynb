And their sequential nature lends themselves well to modelling with RNNs or more recently, Transformers!\n",

    "Me: \n",

    "> Hi [@radek1](https://www.kaggle.com/radek1) Thank you so much for the resources to help beginners to get started.\n",
    "\n",
    "> I have finished watching and [note taking](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/otto-recommender-system/discussion/365039) the getting started videos on recsys from Andrew Ng (which are relatively easy to follow) and I am half way through those of Xavier Amatriain (two more hours to go for lecture 3+4) which I found many concepts are not very familiar and definitely need to rewatch a few more times.\n",
    "\n",
    "> I wonder how much should I understand Xavier's lectures? I know you would approve that the best way to help understanding is to experiment with the models he talked about, but there are no accompany notebooks or codes available from the lectures right?\n",
    "\n",
    "> I wonder have you found or implemented those the models or codes when you study the videos? or do you know where I can find them? or do actually I need to study them now for learning recsys in order to prepare me for participating in OTTO competition? Or maybe focusing on experimenting with your notebooks is already enough for beginners?\n",

    "> Xavier does a great job in his lectures of explaining the reasoning behind recommender systems, I think that is where the value lies. Very few people do that and nearly no one has experience comparable to his 🙂 As in, the thinking behind what you want and why you want to make the decisions that you do.\n",
    "\n",
    "> But on the technical side, I think you will find there is a great disconnect between the ideas and what you can implement in code. Everything is very dataset-specific. In some way, this is another skillset that you have to build up, this ability to transfer those ideas to the problem you are working on. Even one or two ideas can go a long way.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Here, for instance, this is a recommender system competition, but the curve ball is the high cardinality of action ids. How do you deal with this? There has been some really good discussion on this here: [🐘 the elephant in the room -- high cardinality of targets and what to do about this](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/otto-recommender-system/discussion/364722).\n",
    "\n",
    "> Or even more concretely, how do you work with the amount of data that you have available in this competition? This is on a completely different scale than most of the \"toy\" ML problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "> So I think chipping away at this competition and learning from the conversations and the kernels that people post is a great way of getting hands-on experience 🙂 It really does go a long way in actual business context.\n",
