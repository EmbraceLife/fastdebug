    "\n",
    "**It is THE environment to practice your data science skills.**\n",

    "I remember people asking me after the victory \"so what happened next, did you get any job offers because of it? oh no? so I thought\". But in retrospect, they were horribly wrong!\n",
    "\n",
    "I got tens if not hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of value out of this competition! Yes, I won $1200, which roughly paid for half of my DL rig that I used to win the competition (a single 1080ti, what a beauty of a card!¬†![üòÅ](https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/e/notoemoji/14.0/1f601/72.png))\n",

    "**Additionally, this victory gave credibility to me as a DL practitioner. I was no longer some random person on the Internet screaming at the clouds.**\n",
    "\n",
    "It also became a major talking point in my visa application. It's one thing to say you can do something at a world class level. It is a completely different thing to say so and be able to point to supporting evidence.\n",

    "What is the value of all that? I don't know, but I am fairly sure it is easily six figures, if not more.\n",

    "\n",
    "While I believe in the power of Kaggle, the answer is no.\n",
    "\n",
    "But you should seek out good learning environments and projects you can ship that will become your track record.\n",
    "\n",
    "Such projects are a vortex of learning and establishing your credibilty. Building your personal brand. Making life-changing connections.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the Internet, and in life in general, people don't know how awesome you are on the inside. They only know what you show them.\n",
    "\n",
    "**And if you don't put together concrete evidence that you can actually do this stuff, you will be perceived as one of the millions of people in the machine learning limbo.

    "\n",
    "#### step 1: what a lecture\n",
    "It all begins with watching a lecture. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### step 2: run code and experiment\n",
    "The next step is to open the lecture notebook and figure out how all the pieces fit together. The idea is to run each line of code and look at the outputs. If you come across a function you have not previously encountered, this is a good time to read its documentation. How will the performance differ if you pass in different arguments or slightly tweak the hyperparameters?\n",
    "\n",
    "#### step 3: reproduce the result/notebook\n",
    "Once you understand the bigger picture, it‚Äôs time to reproduce the results. To do so, open a new notebook and try to recreate the training pipeline that the lecture demonstrated. It‚Äôs an open-book exercise ‚Äî it‚Äôs okay if you need to look back at the lecture notebook, but the less you do so, the better. On the other hand, there are no limitations on reading the documentation or searching online. Both of these activities are encouraged and they closely resemble what programming feels like when it‚Äôs done completely on your own.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### step 4: apply elsewhere\n",
    "Once everything is up and running, and you have obtained a result similar to that in the lecture, it is time to go a step further. This time, we search for a similar dataset and test drive the technique we just learned about. Your imagination is the only limit here. You could seek out a dataset online or you could put one together yourself. Alternatively, the fast.ai library provides access to many¬†[datasets](https://course.fast.ai/datasets)¬†used for research. You can download them to your machine with a single command.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### the goal of the 4 steps\n",
    "The idea is to systematically grow your skills. You start in a controlled setting of the lecture notebook, learning the ins and outs of the technique that the lecture discussed. With every new exercise, more of the training wheels come off, to the point where **you‚Äôre doing everything on your own from start to finish.**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Be creative at doing the 4 steps above\n",
    "This approach to learning works like a charm. There are no hard and fast rules here and you are more than welcome to modify it as you go. Being creative and coming up with exercises that are challenging and interesting to you is a very valuable skill in its own right; acquiring it will take your learning to the next level. "

    "While practice is the only way to improve your ability to solve real-life machine learning problems, moving toward this way of learning does not require you to revolutionize your life. A couple of minutes a day, over multiple days, is all you need to get started. With every consecutive day of learning, you build momentum. Soon you start to notice the results, and the ability to do things you thought were out of reach not too long ago creates a lot of excitement. Very soon, you will find yourself losing track of time as you explore this or that technique.\n",
