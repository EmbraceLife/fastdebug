    "So as you might expect, just dumping the raw data into a model is not going to very very effective or efficient. That is why sites like YouTube with billions of items of content use a technique known as candidates generation. This technique has been applied in previous recommendation system challenges on Kaggle, and I think it can be applied here to.\n",

    "Now that you have your candidates, you need to generate features for your items. This is kind of tricky in this competition because we only have the article id (we don't have the product name, price, or other useful info). Thus, your features will probably be the reason the item was selected as a candidate. You can also make numerical features related to the candidates generation such as the number of times a item was viewed or repurchased, etc.\n",

    "Now that you have feature engineered items, you want to feed your options to a ranker models. Examples of ranker models include:\n",

However, I will follow Radek's advice to stay with the Kaggle discussion and kernels, make sure I make the most out of them first before I explore new waters /2022-11-13\n",
