    "# What is the co-visiation matrix, really?\n",
    "\n",
    "It is very interesting to think of modern techniques in the context of their roots.\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, when thinking about RNNs we should consider unigram, bigram, and trigram models.\n",
    "\n",
    "What were they?\n",
    "\n",
    "They estimated the probability of a word given the words that came before.\n",
    "\n",
    "We see \"Radek is a **_____**\".\n",
    "\n",
    "In a trigram model, we would consider the chain \"Radek\", \"is\", and \"a\" and could find the most likely word to come next.\n",
    "\n",
    "The easiest way would be to count the occurrences of \"Radek is a\" and the words that came after and pick the one most common.\n",
    "\n",
    "So why RNNs are such a great improvement?\n",
    "\n",
    "Well, there are not that many \"Radek is a **_____**\" in most text corpora!\n",
    "\n",
    "With RNNs (or word2vec) we could operate on embeddings and look at many more words in sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of looking at only \"Radek is a \" we can use \"Radek was an **_____**\", \"Tommy is a **______**\" as examples to learn from, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Embeddings take values of a variable of high cardinality and project them to a representation that ideally captures similarities.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "So how does this relate to the co-visitation matrix?\n",
    "\n",
    "A co-visitation matrix counts the co-occurrence of two actions in close proximity.\n",
    "\n",
    "If a user bought A and shortly after bought B, we store these values together.\n",
    "\n",
    "We calculate counts and use them to estimate the probability of future actions based on recent history.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is quite important to understand what is happening in the co-visitation matrix approach…\n",
    "\n",
    "Since it suffers from the same issues as our trigram example!\n",
    "\n",
    "Plus what does the co-visitation matrix resemble?\n",
    "\n",
    "You are right, it is akin to doing Matrix Factorization by counting!\n",
    "\n",
    "It is really fun that this competition exposed this heuristic (the co-visitation matrix) that I have not been aware of before! 🙏\n",
    "\n",
    "And if you'd like to learn more about the co-visitation matrix and jump straight into the competition, you might find these two notebooks useful. Please upvote if you do!\n",

    "Training Word2Vec would be very helpful. That would produce embeddings such that similar items (with co-visitation) would have distance similar embeddings. It would help us understand what these anonymous item ids represent.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then we could do lots of EDA like how do the items that users purchase over time change? How do items purchased in the morning differ from items purchased in the evening. Etc etc. For each of these analysis, we could plot 2D pictures with clusters of dots (using their Word2Vec embedding 2D projection)\n",

    "\n",
    "Co-visitation matrices are the natural statistical approach. It is a way to compute conditional probabilities. Given a user has interacted with item A, it computes the most likely future items that this user will interact with.\n",
    "\n",
    "And we can make many more specific variants such as given a user has **ordered** item A, what is the most likely item that this user will **click, cart, order** etc. Or given a user has visited this item **in the morning**, what is the most likely item that this user will **order**. Etc etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course if we train a reranker model it will learn all these varieties of conditional probabilities on its own.\n",

    "That is some amazing information [@cdeotte](https://www.kaggle.com/cdeotte), as always! 🙂 Thank you so very much for sharing all this with us 🙏\n",
