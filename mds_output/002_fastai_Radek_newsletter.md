I got my second ML job nearly virtually in parallel to my first one!

When I say job here I don't mean full time work -- it was a consulting role, around 10 hours a week, for around 3 months.

On a winter morning I was sitting at my desk in a co-working space and I saw I got an email. It was from a gentleman from Dubai who was a CTO for a fashion startup.

Remember that Kaggle competition I won as I was doing the¬†[fast.ai](http://fast.ai/)¬†course? I competed in it with the intention of learning.

That gentleman had a very similar problem to solve at his startup! He engaged a couple of companies (sic!) but none of them got very far.

### jn: Radek - do tell the world what you are up to /2022-11-9
There are two components to this story.

First of all, it reinforces the idea that if you do something, even with a modicum of success, make sure to tell the world about it!

I know this feels weird. This still feels weird to me.

Maybe it is because of the culture I was raised in. Or some romantic ideas that got shoveled into my unsuspecting mind as a teenager

No clue.

I am sure it might be similar for you. But I implore you -- do tell the world about what you are up to!

### jn: Radek - Don't worry about how your writing is written /2022-11-9

I tweeted about my victory, wrote about it on Kaggle forums, and of course shared the news with my friends on the¬†[fast.ai](http://fast.ai/)¬†forums. Bear in mind, those tweets were nothing special in terms of how they were written.

Neither were the posts.

It DOESN'T MATTER how good your writing is! Just type those characters out onto a screen and send them into the world.

### jn: Radek - let Kaggle be a life changing experience /2022-11-9
And the second observation about this situation is what happened in the years to come...

People completely do not understand Kaggle. Yes, it is extremely hard to compete. Yes, it takes a rediculous amount of work.

**But Kaggle competitions are a great approximation to a real-life research project. With the exception that you cannot bullshit yourself that you are making progress. You have thousands of other people trying to solve the same problem you are solving.**

Your strength and your weaknesses become exposed.

**It is THE environment to practice your data science skills.**

But that is just one aspect of Kaggle.

I remember people asking me after the victory "so what happened next, did you get any job offers because of it? oh no? so I thought". But in retrospect, they were horribly wrong!

I got tens if not hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of value out of this competition! Yes, I won $1200, which roughly paid for half of my DL rig that I used to win the competition (a single 1080ti, what a beauty of a card!¬†![üòÅ](https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/e/notoemoji/14.0/1f601/72.png))

But I could talk about this competition in the job interviews that followed. In fact, it still remains one of the talking points to this day! I barely remember what I did but it is a good story!

**Additionally, this victory gave credibility to me as a DL practitioner. I was no longer some random person on the Internet screaming at the clouds.**

It also became a major talking point in my visa application. It's one thing to say you can do something at a world class level. It is a completely different thing to say so and be able to point to supporting evidence.

What is the value of all that? I don't know, but I am fairly sure it is easily six figures, if not more.

So what does this all mean for your life? Do you absolutely need to do well in a Kaggle competition? Do you even need to participate in Kaggle at all?

While I believe in the power of Kaggle, the answer is no.

But you should seek out good learning environments and projects you can ship that will become your track record.

Such projects are a vortex of learning and establishing your credibilty. Building your personal brand. Making life-changing connections.

On the Internet, and in life in general, people don't know how awesome you are on the inside. They only know what you show them.

**And if you don't put together concrete evidence that you can actually do this stuff, you will be perceived as one of the millions of people in the machine learning limbo. A person who is a learner, takes course after course, but is not a practitioner. Doesn't go out into the real world and do shit**.

**Be a person who does.**

And that's it for this email, hope you enjoyed it¬†![üòä](https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/e/notoemoji/14.0/1f60a/72.png). In the next email I'll cover... how I got my 3rd machine learning job! And maybe I will slip in a couple of thoughts about working on projects, we'll see¬†![üôÇ](https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/e/notoemoji/14.0/1f642/72.png)

### jn: Radek - how to do project based learning /2022-11-9
If you are however dying right now to read about what project based learning might look like, you might want to give¬†[this blog post](https://click.convertkit-mail2.com/lmumqdwwm4hmh0vvm9xc6/wnh2hghr03g2d6t7/aHR0cHM6Ly9yYWRla29zbXVsc2tpLmNvbS9nb2luZy1mcm9tLW5vdC1iZWluZy1hYmxlLXRvLWNvZGUtdG8tZGVlcC1sZWFybmluZy1oZXJvLw==)¬†a read.

#### step 1: what a lecture
It all begins with watching a lecture. 

#### step 2: run code and experiment
The next step is to open the lecture notebook and figure out how all the pieces fit together. The idea is to run each line of code and look at the outputs. If you come across a function you have not previously encountered, this is a good time to read its documentation. How will the performance differ if you pass in different arguments or slightly tweak the hyperparameters?

#### step 3: reproduce the result/notebook
Once you understand the bigger picture, it‚Äôs time to reproduce the results. To do so, open a new notebook and try to recreate the training pipeline that the lecture demonstrated. It‚Äôs an open-book exercise ‚Äî it‚Äôs okay if you need to look back at the lecture notebook, but the less you do so, the better. On the other hand, there are no limitations on reading the documentation or searching online. Both of these activities are encouraged and they closely resemble what programming feels like when it‚Äôs done completely on your own.

#### step 4: apply elsewhere
Once everything is up and running, and you have obtained a result similar to that in the lecture, it is time to go a step further. This time, we search for a similar dataset and test drive the technique we just learned about. Your imagination is the only limit here. You could seek out a dataset online or you could put one together yourself. Alternatively, the fast.ai library provides access to many¬†[datasets](https://course.fast.ai/datasets)¬†used for research. You can download them to your machine with a single command.

#### the goal of the 4 steps
The idea is to systematically grow your skills. You start in a controlled setting of the lecture notebook, learning the ins and outs of the technique that the lecture discussed. With every new exercise, more of the training wheels come off, to the point where **you‚Äôre doing everything on your own from start to finish.**

#### Be creative at doing the 4 steps above
This approach to learning works like a charm. There are no hard and fast rules here and you are more than welcome to modify it as you go. Being creative and coming up with exercises that are challenging and interesting to you is a very valuable skill in its own right; acquiring it will take your learning to the next level. 

The result is always the same: to arrive at a place where you can comfortably apply the techniques you learn in the lectures to problems you haven‚Äôt previously seen.

#### Allow time to work
While practice is the only way to improve your ability to solve real-life machine learning problems, moving toward this way of learning does not require you to revolutionize your life. A couple of minutes a day, over multiple days, is all you need to get started. With every consecutive day of learning, you build momentum. Soon you start to notice the results, and the ability to do things you thought were out of reach not too long ago creates a lot of excitement. Very soon, you will find yourself losing track of time as you explore this or that technique.

Talk soon,

Radek
