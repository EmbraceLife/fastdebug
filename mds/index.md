# Make Learning Fastai Uncool


## Todos


### 2022.11.7


- [x] a workflow: 1. create a pure verion of code for training models; 2. create code for exploring src; 3. create links to open both codes 
- [ ] redo kaggle paddy part 1 with new workflow
- [ ] share my notes of meta learning and ask Radek for permession of sharing
- [ ] start to work on Radek's notebooks on OTTO competition 
- [ ] display all important forum posts of mine and others I admire 
- [ ] what do I most like to work on and share (kaggle notebooks dissection as a beginner)


## How to use this notebook


### use `fastlistnbs` to check menu

```python
show_doc(fastlistnbs)
```

```python
fastnbs("src: fastlistnbs")
```

```python
hts
```

```python

```

### use `fastnbs` to dive in

```python
show_doc(fastnbs)
```

```python
fastnbs("src: fastnbs")
```

## Search my Journey 

```python

```

```python
fastlistnbs("journey")
```

```python
fastnbs("src: fastnbs")
```

## Search docs

```python
fastlistnbs("doc")
```

```python
fastnbs("doc: ImageDataLoaders")
```

## Search source code


To run actual source code with snoop, but first search with `fastlistnbs` and `export_open_py`

```python
fastlistnbs("srcode")
```

```python
fastnbs("src: download_kaggle")
```

```python
fastnbs("src: export")
```

## Search howto

```python
# show_doc(fastnotes)
# show_doc(fastlistsrcs)

# how to do notes from now on? make them notebooks first for using fastlistnbs and fastnbs
# make howto internal steps breakable?
fastlistnbs("howto")
```

```python
fastnbs('ht: learner save model')
```

```python
fastnbs("doc: learn.export")
```

## Search questions (notes and Q&A on forum) 

```python
fastlistnbs("question")
```

```python
hts
```

```python
# fastnbs("ht: load")
```

## Search Radek

```python
fastlistnbs("radek")
```

```python
fastnbs("rd: experiment")
```

## Search my practice

```python
fastlistnbs("practice")
```

```python
fastnbs("pt: my tool")
```

## Search links

```python
fastlistnbs("links")
```

```python
fastnbs("lk: Radek Otto")
```

```python

```

## Search pyfiles

```python
openpy()
```

```python
openpy('remove failed')
```

```python

```
