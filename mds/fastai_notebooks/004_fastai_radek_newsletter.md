Hey!

This newsletter will be briefÂ ![ðŸ™‚](https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/e/notoemoji/15.0/1f642/72.png)Â We haven't tried a brief newsletter yet, so let's see how it goes!

Deep truth -- everyone in life and on the Internet goes around preoccupied with themselves. Can't blame us, it's just how we are.

Evolution.

Whatever we can do to increase our chances of survival we're game for And that is generally about thinking about ourselves.

So what is the absolute best way to stand out from the self-interested crowd?

You got it! Do something completely selflessly for someone else!

You immediately become so unusual people will pay attention to you.

But there are certain rules of engagements you need to follow.

## How to do something for another person and not be a nuissance

If you are doing something seemingly nice and useful with the intetion to promote YOURSELF, or you expect gratitute, or to show off, you will be ignored (as you should).

We all have only 24 hours in a day.

Imagine what happens if a person is even moderately successful and can be relatively easily found on the Internet...

You got it! People want stuff from them ALL THE TIME.

So if your action plan is to demand something from another person through being nice, your approach is not only morally bankrupt, but also has the very unfortunate side effect of being futile.

On the other hand, if you go about your life and think -- "oh, this person is doing something interesting, is there something I could do to help?" then you flip the situation on its head.

When for a microsecond you are able to switch the focus from yourself to the other person, the world trembles. Fireworks go off.

This is such an unusual event that it unlocks limitless opportunities!

## How do you help other people

You look at what that person is doing and see if you can add genuine value.

Oh, they wrote a blog post? Maybe I can share my appreciation via retweeting it?

Oh, they seem to be maintating a software library? Maybe I can jump in and see if I can resolve an issue or two.

Those don't have to be big things. People do very little without their own interest in mind, so even doing small things where you don't expect to receive everything in return puts you on a completely different playing field.

You see where I am going with this?

Do not introduce yourself.

Do not ask for the time of peope you don't know or where you are adding ZERO value to their undertaking.s

You just go around and be a good citizen AND DON'T EXPECT ANYTHING IN RETURN.

But who has time for doing such things these days!

Anyhow, this brings me to the topic of this newsletter, that is...

## How I got my 4th ML job

I participated in an event organized by a company where I needed that participation for something that was improtant to me at that time.

BUT the people behind the company seemed really cool. That communicated to me two things.

![ðŸ‘‰](https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/e/notoemoji/15.0/1f449/72.png)Â wouldn't it be nice to get to know them better?

![ðŸ‘‰](https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/e/notoemoji/15.0/1f449/72.png)Â wouldn't it be fun to HELP THEM OUT as I had some experience in the area where they operated?

So what did I do?

I sent them a note on the awesome operation that they were running and jotted down a couple of points (based on my experience in the area where they operated) on how they could improve.

It was not forced. It was not fake. Those were real areas of opportunities that someone without my unique experience might not have an easy time noticing.

I didn't expect they would talk back to me.

But they did.

This led to interesting conversations and we started to work togetherÂ ![ðŸ™‚](https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/e/notoemoji/15.0/1f642/72.png)

Maybe it was not such a brief newsletter after all! Anyhow, now you know another of my secrets and can put it to good use in your life!

Talk soon,

Radek
